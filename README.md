# Computer Graphics (OPENGL Codes)

### Compilation
g++ test.cpp -o test_result.out -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm

### Run 
./test_result.out


## SETUP
#### For Windows
##### Can't find definite installation steps, so I used WSL.

* Install [WSL1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
* Install [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) and start a xserver.
* Choose 'One Large Window' option. 
* Open Linux Shell and run OpenGL programs.

Q1. Write a program in C to draw a line by using DDA algorithm when two points are given.

Q2. Write a program in C to draw a line by using DDA algorithm when starting point, slope and number of iterations are given.

Q3. Write a program in C to draw two lines by using DDA algorithm when a common starting point, their slopes (unequal) and number of iterations are given.

Q4. Write a program in C to draw a line by using Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm when two points are given.

Q5. Write a program in C to draw two parallel lines when two points are given for the first line and one point as starting point where x−value is same as in the starting point of the first line and y−value is increased by n (a natural number) for the second line by using Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm.
